# Homework_01-HTML-Git-CSS

The task for this homework was to refactor the HTML and CSS for the provided marketing website. The refactoring focused on accessibility, so it involved changing div tags to semantic tags (header, main, section, etc.), adding alt properties to images, and the like. It also involved some general improvements--e.g., adding comments, adding the source code to a source control (this Git repository), and publishing the page.
